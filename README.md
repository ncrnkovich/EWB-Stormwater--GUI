# EWB Stormwater Fee GUI
 GUI for South Bend website to help calculate the cost and savings of fees and GSI.

Relevant information:
In Dec 2020 in-lieu-of disconnect fee will take effect. This is based on the amount of impervious land on a property. Can search in “SB municode” for “downspout” when looking for some official information

Plans to implement a Stormwater Fee. In current version, $2 /residential property/ month, $5 / commercial property/ month. They want to scale this based on impervious area also, so Walmart is paying more than a mom-and-pop shop. They also want to have credits for implementing GSI.

GUI: online tool, embedded in the SB website to help residents look up projected costs and offer solutions that make sense based on their costs.
Website runs on Wordpress. Believe that involves C++ and some HTML to embed it
If you look up Google area calculator, I think this would be a great feature. We need to look into some open sourced code to do that/talk to some professionals for their opinion on how to do that
We’ll need a list of detailed GSI solutions to offer as solutions, with estimated costs on per unit basis
Lots of good information on this already compiled by interns in report
