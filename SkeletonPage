<h1>South Bend Property Owner Tool</h1>
<p>This calculator is a tool for South Bend property owners to offset some of their city taxes by implementing green infrastructure. 
Simply find your property on the map below, and highlight all impermiable land. The calculator will then offer suggestions for 
stormwater management solutions which will result in a tax credit. It will explain how much you can save, and over how many years.</p>
